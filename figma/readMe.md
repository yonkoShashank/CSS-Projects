In our work we would be provided with a figma file, but we aren't provided with one then it's a game of HIT & TRIAL. Through this project showcased a profile which includes 
HEADER section, BODY section & FOOTER section.
HEADER section appears at the top of the screen which gives us options to browse from so does this webpage, it is horizontally set using FLEX property.
BODY section contains the text content & the pictures which can placed side to side using FLEX or GRID or by giving width division.
FOOTER section usually contains details which are less required yet very necessary, again placed side to side using FLEX.
