            <h2 id="id2">DayBreak</h2>
            <p class="paraclass">Akatsuki (暁, literally meaning: "Dawn" or "Daybreak") was a group of shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was led by different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals, all seek to make the world a better place through their own means. Each Akatsuki tended to have multiple lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures that protected them.</p>
            
            <div class="backg Nagato">
                <h2 class="member">Nagato</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Nagato (長門) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan. Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.</p>
            
            <div class="backg Konan">
                <h2 class="member">Konan</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Konan (小南) was a kunoichi from Amegakure and a founding member of the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with Nagato, who had since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call him by his name. After Nagato's death, Konan defected from Akatsuki and became the de facto village head of Amegakure.</p>

            <div class="backg Zetsu">
                <h2 class="member">Zetsu</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Black Zetsu and White Zetsu are allies of Tobi who helped him approach Nagato and officially joined Akatsuki seemingly long before Tobi. Although they exist as two separate identities, most of the time they are merged together and act as the singular Akatsuki member, Zetsu. The two sometimes argue, but it never interferes with their duties: spying, evidence disposal, and resource acquisition. Zetsu is often the only member of Akatsuki other than their partners that members meet in person. Zetsu typically helps transport a jinchūriki to one of Akatsuki's hideouts for extracting the Tailed Beast.</p>

                <h2 class="member">Orochimaru</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Orochimaru (大蛇丸) is one of Konohagakure's legendary Sannin. With a life-ambition to learn all of the world's secrets, Orochimaru seeks immortality so that he might live all of the lives necessary to accomplish his task. After being caught red-handed performing unethical experiments on his fellow citizens for the sake of this immortality, Orochimaru defected from Konoha rather than be persecuted for his ambitions, and for many years sought the village's destruction in order to take revenge and demonstrate what he had learned. After several apparent deaths in the pursuit of his goals, Orochimaru realises his approach is flawed through Kabuto Yakushi, his former associate, and begins monitoring the choices and actions of his former apprentice, Sasuke Uchiha.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Sasori (サソリ), renowned as Sasori of the Red Sand (赤砂のサソリ, Akasuna no Sasori), was an S-rank missing-nin from Sunagakure's Puppet Brigade and a member of Akatsuki, where he was partnered with Orochimaru and later Deidara.At the time of his death, Sasori had not yet captured his assigned tailed beast. A short dialogue between himself and Deidara suggested that Sasori did not even know what beast he had been assigned to target.[33] However, after his death, Tobi took his place as Deidara's new partner and his ring in Akatsuki, and, later, he captured the Three-Tails, thereby suggesting that the beast was Sasori's targe</p>

                <h2 class="member">Itachi Uchiha</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ|Uchiha Itachi) is a major character and an anti-villain in the Naruto franchise.

                He is an ANBU Captain and a prodigy from Konohagakure's famed Uchiha clan, the son of Fugaku Uchiha, the clan's chief, and Mikoto Uchiha, and the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He is also the brother-in-law of Sakura Haruno, and the paternal uncle of Sarada Uchiha.
                
                He became an S-rank missing-nin as he participated in the murder of his entire clan, defected from the village, then joined the criminal organization Akatsuki. This causes Sasuke to desire revenge at any cost and later turn to Orochimaru while seeking the power to kill his older brother, making Itachi indirectly responsible for Sasuke's turn to villainy. Because of the Uchiha clan massacre, Itachi was vilified and served as a supporting antagonist for a large part of the series (until his death). However, after Itachi died out of sickness during the fight against Sasuke, it is revealed that Itachi was actually a double-spy that killed his clan on orders from higher-ups. No one in the Hidden Leaf village apart from a few important people knew that the Uchiha clan was plotting an insurrection primarily concerned with themselves, so Itachi killed them all primarily concerned with protecting the Hidden Leaf Village and his younger brother.</p>

After defecting from the village, he was forced into Akatsuki and was its youngest member.

            <p class="paraclass">Kakuzu (角都) was an S-rank missing-nin from Takigakure and a member of Akatsuki who was partnered with Hidan. Kisame Hoshigaki jokingly referred to them as the Zombie Combo (ゾンビコンビ, Zonbi Konbi, English TV: Zombie Pair),[3] due to the fact that, in differing senses, they could not die.</p>

There, he was partnered with Kakuzu, despite the two's somewhat mutual dislike of each other. He was also the second newest member of Akatsuki at the time of Tobi's introduction.[3] Kisame Hoshigaki laughingly referred to Hidan and Kakuzu as the Zombie Combo (ゾンビコンビ, Zonbi Konbi, English TV: Zombie Pair)</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paraclass">Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a change of heart and, as atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he sought to replace.</p>
