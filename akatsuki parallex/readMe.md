Using the knowledge I gained tried to make a parallex website the thought process behind it 
Perspective: Applied to the #outer container, this property provides a 3D perspective to its child elements.

Transform: Used on .inner, #akatsuki, and #madara, this property allows for 3D transformations like scaling and translation, creating depth perception.

Background properties: Background images are applied to various elements using classes like .Nagato, .Konan, etc., with background-image, background-position, and background-size properties for styling.

Positioning: Absolute positioning (position: absolute;) is used for #akatsuki, #madara, and .member, positioning them precisely within their parent containers.

Color and Text Styling: Text elements are styled with colors, font sizes (font-size), background colors, and shadow effects (text-shadow) to enhance readability and aesthetics.

Box Model: The box model is managed using properties like margin, padding, and border-radius to control spacing, layout, and rounded corners.

Scrolling: overflow properties (overflow-x, overflow-y) are utilized on #outer to enable scrolling along both axes.

Responsive Design: The use of percentages for widths and heights ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes (width: 100%; height: 100vh;).

Z-index: Z-index is set for some elements (z-index: -1;) to control their stacking order, ensuring proper layering for the parallax effect.

Parallax Effect: Achieved through the combination of perspective, 3D transformations, and scrolling, creating an illusion of depth and immersion as the user navigates through the website.
